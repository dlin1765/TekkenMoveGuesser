They really gave the bear the best ewgf shit is so funny
Hits mid not high And even shitty version is +5
Oh I did not know ewgf wasn’t a mid
if its still hard to side step like in t7 kuma might actually be fucking crazy lmfaooo
buffed throws and buffed tackle stance are so cool
i forgot that they gave her a fucking combo throw
throws having smaller tech window and ch throws untechable?
bro ch throws are demonic in this game
than spamming d2 from t7
qcf+2, also colloquially known as deathfist
deathfist is an astonishingly high damage whiff punish tool that hits mid, and becomes even more powerful in heat.
he is one of the select few characters with a heat Smash that also hits low, giving paul an even more terrifying mixup while in heat
exploitable strings outside df+1 and WS1,2
all heat engagers launch on heat dash
heat gives him farther wallsplats and relative safety for deathfisting moves as well as the ability to guard break, and low heat smash is only -12 on block
excellent keepout with qcb+4, qcb+2, and df+2
G=great punishment suite, wall splatting at i12 standing or i13 crouching, can launch from standing at i14 or i13 during heat
also need to figure out a clean way to do wr moves cuz fff3 is so good
i got hit by the command throw I think 16 times on ranked today
it’s an unbreakable throw
reina does a jab string
the jab string that goes into it is -14 ob and doesnt transition unless its on hit
bro drag has the same shit, unbreakable grab
why is it a counter hit launcher
its a kick that puts me in crouch 
finally getting consistent with my hellsweep inputs
I can stop getting my cheeks clapped by victor oki
ssl duck evades all of the hyp stance options after f2,1 and you can ssr the last hit of f2,1,2
this char goes into heat (her engagers are insane) 
orbital launcher safe on block
stuff that ends in backturn that’s -11 against drag gives him access to 1,3,2 which is normally a gapped string but in backturn you can’t block
side step move thats plus on block
moves that do not crush 
evasive shoulder that hits mid 
mid evasive shoulder 
jab string that ends with a low 
jab string with homing third hit
a jab string with homing on the third attack
jab combo featuring a tracking third hit
chip damage (esp in heat again) feels way too overtuned
This parry along with his other tools forces the opponent to second guess their offense and how they take their plus frames
fast counter hit launcher
long kick that counterhit launches 
evasive punch move that does little damage
short low poke 
long range low slide 
what ur talking about is crouch jabs, in rhat case s.low means special low
she has no weakness point, launcher is safe like f+2
yoshimitsu's flash dunks on reina's ff+2 on block
the second hit of the powercrush is launch punishable.
safe mid knee that counterhit launches 
powered up string that guard breaks
reina's twirl grab 
her throws out of her twirling stance and the one where she crouches down are both untechable
evasive shoulder that knocks down
low that launches on hit
while standing launchers
some characters are built around not having while rising launchers as like a compensatory weakness
couldn’t you ws1 in the same situation for counter hit combo
her mixups in heat are absurdly safe and chunk you
she has a ton of scary mid launchers and heat engagers
string of kicks that heat engages
having a combo throw is also very good
ngl plus frames are high key over rated in Tekken
approaching plus on block punch 
but if someone does plus six move, and I stand there
+6 on a character with unreactable low
low that hits ground and flips over
homing mid that counter hit launches 
homing high that goes into stance 
unblockable breath move 
spinning kick string 
multi hit low move 
triple low move 
throw leaves you in knockdown state
the untechable grab and the tracking mid 
i was mashing jab the moment he transitioned 
bro did heat engager into the same string 
she just swings her arms at you and it launches
new mid CH Launcher B+4

Heihachi gets a full launcher on f4 
u can throw punish certain armor moves and get more dmg than like ur -12 punish
you make my heat burst
there were so many power crushes this set
armored stance 
super armor 
the low extension is +3 
the mid extension is unsafe on block though 
you can duck the high extension and you can side step the mid extension
my df1 evaded by matterhorn when I was +5
taunt 
high damage punch heat engager
yeah it forces crouch and is +3
ik her important buttons are her jabs, b1, df1
df1, df3, df4 are all extremely good neutral buttons, all mids too
nah this shit would’ve hit my fc df4, i got hit the other day
Yoshi actually has a very similar unlockable setup where if u get up he gets free heat engage and if u stay on the ground he gets free dmg
+4 mid and died every time
he does like 2 1 low, or 2 1 mid, 2 1 delay mid, and theyre all safe except for the low and theyre also ch launchers
give me my tracking on ff2
safe, extremely high-evading mid, Close-range whiff punish. 
has some high evasion on startup, but punishable at -14
